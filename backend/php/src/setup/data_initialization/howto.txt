Hello there,

To make use of the Data Initialization feature in POG Setup, put your insert statements in the data_initialization.sql file. (One per line).
Then, on step 1 of Setup, choose "Drop, recreate tables and reset data":

This will 

1. Drop any tables that have the same name as the object(s) you have in the objects folder.
2. Recreate the tables and indexes(if needed)
3. Execute the insert statements in data_initialization.sql one by one.

Regards,
The POG Team
