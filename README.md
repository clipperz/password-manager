# Clipperz 

## What is Clipperz
Clipperz is an online password manager; the current application is available [here](https://clipperz.is). Given its age, it is high time to reimplement and improve it. This branch contains the new version of Clipperz, written in Purescript and Scala.

## Epsilon version (Îµ)
The frontend uses Purescript; the [Concur](https://github.com/purescript-concur) library is used to build the UI, the [Affjax](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-affjax) library to communicate with the backend and the [subtlecrypto](https://github.com/clipperz/purescript-subtlecrypto/tree/clipperz) library that provides the basic cryptographic functions, creating a wrapping for Purescript of the ones implemented in browsers.

The backend uses Scala, in particular the [ZIO](https://github.com/zio/zio) library in combination with [zio-json](https://github.com/zio/zio-json), [zio-http](https://github.com/zio/zio-http) and [zio-cache](https://github.com/zio/zio-cache) to build the server and communicate with the frontend.

The implementation of SRP v6a is self implemented both in Purescript and Scala.

### Current status - 10/01/2024
In the current stage of development the backend is functionally complete.
The frontend is almost functionally identical to the current version, except for the offline copy (which implementation is still ongoing) and attachments, that we are not 100% sure we are going to keep around. Another important thing yet to be implemented is a cryptographically secure prng.
On the other hand during the development we have added a few smaller features (like Markdown in notes and saving the password preferences for each locked field).
Another bigger feature implemented is the one-time share. It is yet to be incorporated in the main application, but it has a [dedicated page in the website](https://clipperz.is/share).

## Developing
Necessary tools:
- `NodeJS`: if on a Unix like system, our advice is to use [`nvm`](http://nvm.sh), otherwise you can find [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) the official distribution
- [`Scala 3 + sbt`](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/)

### Building and running the application
All the building and running of the application is managed by sbt, that under the hood uses yarn to manage the Purescript side.
On a console, in the base folder run `sbt` to open the sbt console, after that the command `r` (or `runAll`) builds the whole project, both Scala and Purescript and then starts the Scala server that also serves the frontend at `localhost:8090/api/static/index.html`.
 
### Running tests
Command to run inside of the sbt console to execute tests:
- Scala
	- `Test/compile`: compiles the tests
	- `test`: runs all the Scala tests
	- `testOnly {path of the test suit}` (ex: `testOnly is.clipperz.backend.SrpFunctionsConversionsSuite`): run a specific test suite
	- `Test/run`: show a list of all the test suits from which you can choose one to run
- Purescript
	- `testPurescript`: starts a server on `localhost:9000`
		- the path `/static/test_index.html` serve a page that runs the Purescript tests on browser and prints the result in the page itself
		- the path `/static/debug_index.html` serve a page for debugging purpose, allowing to view the static page corresponding to a state of the application
- `t` (or `testAll`): run `test` first and `testPurescript` after that. Note that if a Scala test doesn't pass `testPurescript` will not be executed.

### Debug
As described in the above, the `testPurescript` command will execute a server that serves on address `localhost:9000/static/debug_index.html` the debug page.
In the main application, using the key-combination `ctrl+alt+c` (or pressing the `DEBUG` button in the bottom right corner) will copy the app state.
Keeping the `Shift` key pressed will slow down the operation's animations.

### Docker images
```
sbt docker:publishLocal
```

or

```
docker build . --platform=linux/amd64 -t clipperz --build-arg CURRENT_COMMIT_ARG=`git rev-parse HEAD`
```

To run:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v ${PWD}/target/archive/user:/archive/user -v ${PWD}/target/archive/blob:/archive/blob clipperz
```
