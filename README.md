# ![Clipperz icon][icon] CLIPPERZ - Online Password Manager

[icon]: ./Icon.png

##What does Clipperz do?

Clipperz is an online vault where you can store confidential data without worrying about security. It can be used to save and manage passwords, private notes, burglar alarm codes, credit and debit card details, PINs, software keys, …
Since passwords are the most common type of private information that you need to protect, we have added a great deal of functionality to make Clipperz a great [online password manager][home] thus solving the “password fatigue” problem.

**Clipperz makes the Internet the most convenient and safe place to keep you most precious and sensitive data.**

## Why an open source version

Because we want to enable as many people as possible to play with our code. So that you can start trusting it, the code not the developers.

In order to allow you to inspect the code and analyze the traffic it generates between client and server, we had to provide an easy way to locally deploy the whole service.

Feel free to host on your machine a web service identical to [Clipperz online password manager][home]. You can choose among **multiple backends** (PHP/MySQL, Python/AppEngine, …) or you can [contribute][CA] your own. 

Whatever is your motivation, we would love to hear from you: [get in contact!][contact]

## Donations
If you like what Clipperz is building, its openness and its view of cryptography as a powerful tool for liberty, then you may consider making a donation. 

Our favorite payment method is clearly Bitcoin ([learn why here][why]), but you can also send your donation via credit card, Paypal or bank transfer. In all cases there will be no link between your real identity and your encrypted data stored on Clipperz.

## Warnings
Please note that the open source version of Clipperz Password Manager may not be suitable for mass deployments, depending on how robust is the backend you select. As an example, the current PHP backend lacks several critical capabilities such as bot protection and concurrent sessions management.

## Building
In order to build the deployable version, you need to invoke the following command:

    git clone git@github.com:clipperz/password-manager.git
    cd password-manager
    ./scripts/build install --backends php python --frontends beta gamma
	
The output will be available in the `target` folder, with a separate folder for each backend (currently the available options are `php` and `python`).
The script, invoked with these parameters, will build both the full version (`install` -> index.html) and the debug version (index_debug.html) of the specified frontends.

Besides PHP and Python, more backends are in the works, most notably a node.js version.


### Developing
To support the development of the application, a few extra tools have been built, the most useful one being `dev-proxy`.
This script, located in `scripts/dev-proxy`, is invoked without any parameters (to simplify daily usage) and all its configurations are hard coded into the actual code it executes: `scripts/proxy/main.py`.

The aim of this proxy is to mask the actual location of frontend JS files from the actual backend handling requests.

When executed, this script will start listening on localhost:8888.

All 'backend' requests (whose path starts with either `/json` or `/dump`) will be forwarded to the actual backend, that is configured as a `ReverseProxyResource` (in the current code: `proxy.ReverseProxyResource('localhost', 8084, '/java-backend')`).
All other requests (html files, Javascript code, CSS stylesheets and other resources) will be handled by reading the resource from the filesystem; the proxy is aware of the layout of the project, so it will be able to locate the right resource in the right place.

The only file that needs to be `build`, and not read directly from the file system, is the `index.html` file.

In order to build this file, the following command should be executed:

	./scripts/build --frontends beta gamma gamma.mobile --backends dev


Once the index.html files have been built (one for each frontend) and a backend is running and has been correctly configured in the proxy script, it is possible to access the different versions of the application at the following URLs:

- `http://localhost:8888/beta/index.html`
- `http://localhost:8888/gamma/index.html`
- `http://localhost:8888/gamma/index.mobile.html`


## Installing

### PHP + MySQL backend

* **PHP**
  Once the project has been successfully build, the application needs to be moved in a location where the web server can run it. Everything that is needed is located into `target/php`.

* **MySQL**
  The application needs a simple MySQL database; to configure all the credentials to access the previously allocated DB, edit the file found in `php/configuration.php`. You need to edit the file actually used by the web server; this will usually be the one moved into the right place in the previous step.  
  Once the application is in place, and the DB credentials have been configured, you should initialize the DB itself; in order to do so, just point your browser at the following url: `http://<host>/<path>/php/setup/index.php`.  
  Here you will find the standard [POG][pog] setup page: it should be enough to click the "POG me up!" button at the bottom of the page, and then the "Process" button on the next page.  
  The POG interface will allow also a very basic access to the DB data that may be useful to check that the application is actually writing something on the DB (even if you will not be able to make much sense out of the data you will see, as they are all encrypted!)  
  More information about building the PHP backend may be found in the `doc/install.php.txt` file.

  But if you have setup a $configuration['setup_password'] in target/php/configuration.php then a page with a textfield and a "Submit" link will appear.
  Just input your $configuration['setup_password'] value and click on "Submit" so [POG][pog] setup page will appear.

## Disclaimer

This application has not been fully tested, so there may be still problems due to the new build script or to the new repository structure. So, for the moment, **use it at your own risk!**
